## Goals

* **Simple and Clear**

    * As few dependencies as possible, with a clear purpose for each.
    * Code is readable and understandable and achieves only what is outlined here in the goals, nothing more.

* **Flux Architecture**

    * Simple Flux implementation inspired by (and probably pretty interchangeable with) Redux.
    * Top level `Store` object with as many child stores as necessary.
    * Simple cache for `Store` data.
    * Only actions should update the stores.
    * Higher order components are used to add a `Store` reference to React `context` and to re-render components on any change to store.


* **Universal**

    * App renders content on the server before client takes over.

* **Routing**

    * A single file defines routes **and their action dependencies** for both server and client.
    * Action dependencies reflect the routing hierarchy (a child route will ensure that both its and its parents' dependencies are present).

* **Styles**

    * CSS Modules provide modular (component-scoped classes) and reusable (composable) CSS that brings order to the global scope and explicitly ties CSS into the component hierarchy while still just being simple CSS files.
    * Preprocessors, etc. can be added easily as desired.

* **Development flow and Build Process**

    * All JS uses ES6 syntax via Babel.
    * Webpack provides module bundling.
    * Code splitting can be implemented **on the router level**.
    * Dev Mode: Re-compile bundle(s) and re-start server on any change.
    * Hot Module Replacement Mode: Optional hot reloading for React components and CSS modules.


## !Goals

* Functional stores (reducers, like redux).
* Store-specific re-renders (re-render triggered on entire component tree on any store update).
* UI tests


## Setup

**requires node v4! make sure your environment is up to date**

`npm install`

### Production

`npm run start`

Compiles assets via `npm run build` and then starts the web server in production mode.
`npm run build` just runs `webpack` to compile both the client and server rendering bundle in production mode.
CSS is extracted into a separate static file (main.css), which is added to the index.jade template on the web server.

*NOTE: `ExtractTextPlugin` is __not__ run in `allChunks` mode by default, so CSS required by routes that are split out into separate chunks will not be extracted. That CSS is added on the client in a `<style>` tag, which might create a FOUC and be undesirable. Webpack is [very flexible](https://webpack.github.io/docs/stylesheets.html#separate-css-bundle) with how it handles stylesheets and a specific strategy should be implemented based on the requirements of the particular site.*


### Development

`npm run build:dev`

Compiles assets for development with webpack in watch mode, re-compiling on any file change.
CSS is loaded on the client via `<style>` tags (using `style-loader`).

`npm run start:dev`

Starts the web server via nodemon to re-start on any change (such as when webpack re-compiles the server-render bundle).


### Hot Module Replacement

*Note: This runs "vanilla webpack HMR" since most state is in the Flux store, as recommended [here](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/pull/1455)*

`npm run build:hot`

Runs the `build:dev` script with HMR flag so it only compiles the server-render bundle (since the client bundle is handled by the webpack-dev-server).

`npm run start:hot`

Runs the `start:dev` script with HMR flag which tells the server to retrieve the client scripts from the webpack-dev-server.

`npm run hot`

Compiles the client bundle with hot module replacement and serves it on port 8080 via webpack-dev-server.

## TODOs

* Add Testing framework (Jest) and some unit test examples.
* Routing

    * Add a way to define blocking actions on routes. i.e. actions that must complete *before* the route component is rendered.  
    * Add a way to define error handling for route dependencies. In general, this would be for client-side 404-type situations so that a 404 page can be shown without a flicker.
